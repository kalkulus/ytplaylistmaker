# YTPlaylistMaker - Easiest and fastest way to create a YouTube playlist

You know a bunch of songs you would like to quickly add to a new or existing YouTube playlist but you don't want to go and search for each one, click on it and then add it to a playlist.

Well, now you don't have to.

Just create a new playlist, or select and existing one, enter the names of the songs(preferably with artist names) and add them all together.

The system is not perfect, sometimes it might not find the song or get the version you don't like, but for the most part it will find an ok version of the song.

YouTube search is smart enought to give us good results and then I used Levenshtein distance algorythm to find the best matching title. The algorythm immplementation came from Andrew Hedges, you can check it out [here](http://andrew.hedges.name/experiments/levenshtein/).

Give it a go, and if you have any feedback feel free to contact me.
